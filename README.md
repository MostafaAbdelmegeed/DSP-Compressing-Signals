# DSP-Compressing-Signals
A GUI that allows you to browse, open, choose a method of compression any kind of 1D signals

## Tasks
### 1- GUI Designing
  * Browse button that browses and opens a signal file. **Mano** _Have to look for extensions for each signal file type_
  * File may be in any readable format, do bug proofing and don't allow any inapropriate files to be opened.
  * Combo box to choose mode of compression. (2 modes: Lossy or Lossless) **Gamila**
  * Combo box to choose Basis functions. (4 functions: DCT, DWT and 2 other functions of our search)
  * Plot the original signal and the decompressed one to see the missing data! **As'ad**
### 2- Algorithms
  * Encoding algorithm to compress the file & The Decoding algorithm for that encoding algorithm. **Gamila**
  * DCT code & DWT code. **Mano**
  * 2 Basis function that could be used.	**As'ad**
  * Calculate compression ratio for all signals with all basis functios. **Gamila**  **As'ad**

### 3- Data Gathering
  * Audio signal. **Already Done from Task (2)**
  * ECG signal. **Already Done from Task (1)**
  * 1D ultrasound. (A-mode) **Mano**
  * MR Spectroscopy.	**As'ad**
